# MailMe - send templated mails

MailMe is meant to deliver transaction mails with a template that can be loaded
from a URL. If no template is present from the URL it will fall back to a default
template.

This makes it easy to deploy your mail templates to a CDN (with Netlify) and have
an easy workflow to work with the mails and preview them directly in the browser.
